    <b> Introduction </b>
    <p>
        This diagram is created as an example by Github user deepthiyathiender, presummably, for the author to showcase a force-directed network graph. Nodes are visualized to 'pull' towards other randomly selected nodes. 
    </p>
    <b> Criticisms on data </b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            N.A as too many information is generated randomly.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <b> Criticisms on idiom </b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The criticisms below assume that the objective of the diagram is to eventually show how connected these popular websites are.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Text labelling:<br>
            Graph is entirely illegible. Text should minimally be plotted 'above' the circle patches and wrapped inside circle. 
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Visual weight with radius:<br>
            When discussing 'connectivity', visualizing absolute sizes gives a complimentary insight to a chart primarily about relativeness. Most appropriate to show with radius.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Visual weight of edges:<br>
            While the edges of a force-directed graph represent crucial links, it is not very visually informative to see all edges at once. 
            The author should consider applying a hierarchy to the visual weight with mouseover events.
            Furhtermore, lineweight can be used ordinally to add another visually clear dimension of insights
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce dimensionality with clustering:<br>
            In my opinion, the final outcome of force-directed network graphs should include a clustering algorithm, with the objective to color websites linked to each other in similar tones. This may not be a practical idea as it is likely that most popular websites these days are linked to many other popular websites. Yet this makes identifying independent media websites ever more valuable.
